# Video Deepfake Strategy

## Simple Explanation
Deepfakes are usually face-swaps or lip-syncs. They are like very good digital masks. But masks can slip.

*   **Blinking:** Early deepfakes forgot to blink. Modern ones blink, but often too regularly or at the wrong times.
*   **Lip Sync:** Sometimes the mouth moves, but the shape doesn't match the sound being spoken (like a badly dubbed movie).
*   **The "Jitter":** If you look closely at the edges of a face in a deepfake, you might see it jitter or blur when the person turns their head quickly. The computer loses track of where the face should be.

## Technical Explanation

Video analysis is computationally intensive, treating video as a sequence of images with temporal consistency requirements.

### 1. Frame-by-Frame Artifacts (Mesoscopic Analysis)
*   **Process:** We extract frames at 1-second intervals.
*   **Model:** XceptionNet (FaceForensics++ Pre-trained).
*   **Focus:** This CNN looks for compression artifacts and blending boundaries where the fake face is overlaid onto the target head.

### 2. Temporal Consistency (RNN/LSTM)
*   **Problem:** Some deepfakes look perfect in a single screenshot but flicker in motion.
*   **Solution:** We use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track facial landmarks over time.
    *   **Jitter Detection:** We measure the "euclidean distance" of landmark movement between frames. Superhuman acceleration of facial features indicates a tracking error common in deepfakes.

### 3. Lip-Sync Verification (Wav2Lip)
*   **Cross-Modal Check:** We verify the correlation between the Audio Track and the Visual Lip Movements.
*   **Technique:** We use a model like SyncNet. It accepts a window of video frames and the corresponding audio segment. It outputs a "confidence score" of how well the lip shapes (visemes) match the sounds (phonemes). Low correlation = Deepfake/Dubbed.

### 4. Pulse Detection (rPPG)
*   **Remote Photoplethysmography:** Real faces flush slightly with every heartbeat (imperceptible to eye, visible to camera).
*   **Detection:** We analyze subtle color changes in the skin to detect a heart rate signal. Deepfakes generated by GANs typically lack this biological pulse signal.
